				<h2>Mercedes-Benz</h2>
				<span class="text"
					>Mercedes-Benz traces its origins to Karl Benz's first internal
					combustion engine in a car, seen in the Benz Patent Motorwagen –
					financed by Bertha Benz's dowry and patented in January 1886 – and
					Gottlieb Daimler and their engineer Wilhelm Maybach's conversion of a
					stagecoach, with the addition of a petrol engine, introduced later
					that year. The Mercedes automobile was first marketed in 1901 by
					Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft (DMG). Emil Jellinek-Mercedes, an
					Austrian automobile entrepreneur who worked with DMG, registered the
					trademark in 1902, naming the 1901 Mercedes 35 hp after his daughter
					Mercedes Jellinek. Jellinek was a businessman and marketing strategist
					who promoted "horseless" Daimler automobiles among the highest circles
					of society. At the time, it was a meeting place for the haute volée of
					France and Europe, especially in winter. His customers included the
					Rothschild family and other wealthy clients, but as early as 1901, he
					was selling Mercedes cars in the "New World" as well, including to
					billionaires Rockefeller, Astor, Morgan, and Taylor. At the Nice race
					he attended in 1899, Jellinek drove under the pseudonym "Monsieur
					Mercédès". Many consider that race the birth of Mercedes-Benz as a
					brand. In 1901, the name "Mercedes" was re-registered by DMG worldwide
					as a protected trademark. The first Mercedes-Benz branded vehicles
					were produced in 1926, following the merger of Karl Benz and Gottlieb
					Daimler's companies into the Daimler-Benz company on 28 June of the
					same year.
